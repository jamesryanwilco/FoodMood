1.  **Body State (3 options):**
    -   **Tense ‚ö°:** Physical tension, alert, activated.
    -   **Relaxed üåä:** At ease, comfortable, present.

2.  **Emotion Tone (3 options):**
    -   **Pleasant üòä:** Positive emotional experience.
    -   **Neutral üòê:** Neither positive nor negative.
    -   **Unpleasant üòî:** Negative emotional experience.

3.  **Energy Level (3 options):**
    -   **High üî•:** Intense, strong energy.
    -   **Moderate ‚öñÔ∏è:** Balanced, steady energy.
    -   **Low üåô:** Calm, gentle energy.
