## App Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that by helping people become more aware of why they eat and how food makes them feel, they'll naturally make better choices that improve energy, wellbeing, and performance, without needing to track calories.

### Page 1: What is Mindful Eating?

Mindful eating is the practice of paying full attention to the experience of eating, without judgment. It's about being present with your food, your body, and your mind before, during, and after meals.

Here's what that looks like:

-   **Awareness of emotions and triggers:** Recognising the emotional or situational reasons you eat, and creating space to respond intentionally.
-   **Tuning into hunger and fullness:** Learning to identify when you're truly hungry, when you're satisfied, and when you might be eating out of habit, stress, or boredom.
-   **Slowing down:** Eating more slowly to fully taste and enjoy your food.
-   **Reducing distractions:** Protecting mealtimes from screens or multitasking, so you can reset your nervous system and truly engage with your meal.
-   **Engaging your senses:** Noticing the colours, smells, textures, and flavours of your food to increase satisfaction, awareness and enjoyment.
-   **Non-judgmental observation:** Letting go of guilt and avoiding labels like "good" or "bad" food. Instead, focusing on how food makes you feel.

Mindful eating helps you reconnect with the experience of eating, your body and yourself. Over time, it leads to a healthier, more enjoyable, and sustainable relationship with eating. A relationship that supports energy, wellbeing, and performance.

### Page 2: How the App Works

This app supports your mindful eating journey through two short check-ins: one before eating and one about an hour after.

**Before Eating**

You'll reflect on:

-   What you're about to eat
-   How you're feeling emotionally, physically, and in terms of hunger
-   Why you're eating (e.g. hunger, habit, emotion, routine)

This builds awareness around your choices, triggers, and hunger cues, so eating becomes more intentional.

**After Eating**

You'll reflect on:

-   How the eating experience felt
-   How full, satisfied, and energised you feel afterwards
-   How your emotions may have shifted

By checking in, you naturally slow down, reduce distractions, and become more connected to the eating process. Over time, this strengthens your ability to make choices that actually support your energy and wellbeing.

**Spot the Patterns**

Your reflections are turned into simple visual insights, helping you spot patterns between how you eat and how you feel. With this clarity, you can make informed, empowered changes, without calorie counting or guilt required.

### Page 3: Set Your Intention

This isn't about chasing perfection.

It's about tuning in, building awareness, and making small, meaningful changes that actually last.

Before you begin, take a moment to set an intention for your journey. Choose a focus that feels realistic, personal, and energising, not punishing or overwhelming.

Here are some examples to inspire you:

**Awareness & Mindset**
- "I want to understand my emotional eating triggers."
- "I want to slow down and enjoy my meals more."
- "I want to feel more in control of my food choices."
- "I want to eat without guilt."

**Health & Energy**
- "I want to have more consistent energy throughout the day."
- "I want to reduce bloating and discomfort after meals."
- "I want to improve my digestion."
- "I want to support my immune system with better nutrition."

**Strength & Performance**
- "I want to fuel my body to support my workouts."
- "I want to build muscle or maintain a healthy weight without strict tracking."
- "I want to feel strong and nourished, not restricted."
