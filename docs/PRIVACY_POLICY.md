# Privacy Policy for The Check-In

**Last Updated:** July 18, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in The Check-In mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Our Approach to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Our goal is to provide you with a powerful tool for mindful eating while collecting only the minimum data necessary to improve our app and your experience.

## 2. Data You Provide (Stored Locally)

The core functionality of the App is to allow you to record your own experiences. All data you enter into the App, including but not limited to meal descriptions, emotions, motivations, energy levels, goals, and notes, is stored **only on your local device**. This data is not transmitted to us or any third party. We do not have access to it. It remains on your device and is under your control.

## 3. Data We Collect for Analytics

To understand how our app is used and to identify areas for improvement, we collect anonymized analytics data about user interactions. This helps us understand which features are popular, diagnose problems, and enhance the overall user experience. The data we collect for analytics includes:

*   **Product Interaction Data:** Such as which screens are viewed or when a core feature (like completing a check-in) is used.
*   **Identifiers:** We use an anonymous User ID and Device ID to distinguish between different users and devices for analytical purposes. These IDs are not linked to your real-world identity.
*   **Coarse Location:** We collect non-specific location data (like your country or city) based on your IP address. We do not collect your precise GPS location.
*   **Diagnostic Data:** This includes anonymous crash logs and performance data (e.g., app version, device type) to help us find and fix bugs.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services to process our analytics data:

*   **Segment:** A customer data platform that helps us manage and route our analytics data.
*   **Mixpanel:** A product analytics tool that helps us analyze the usage data to improve our app.

These services are contractually obligated to handle your data securely and are prohibited from sharing it.

## 5. Your Consent

By using the App, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
