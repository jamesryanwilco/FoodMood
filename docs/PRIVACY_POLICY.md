# Privacy Policy for The Check-In

**Last Updated:** June 24, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in The Check-In mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Data We Do Not Collect

We have a simple approach to privacy: we do not collect any personally identifiable information. When you use our App, we **do not** collect, store, or have access to:

*   Your name, email address, phone number, or other personal contact information.
*   Your location data.
*   Your photos or contacts.
*   Any financial information.
*   Any data related to your health via Apple's HealthKit or other services.

## 2. Data You Provide

The core functionality of the App is to allow you to record your own experiences. All data you enter into the App, including but not limited to meal descriptions, emotions, motivations, energy levels, goals, and notes, is stored **only on your local device**.

This data is not transmitted to us or any third party. We do not have access to it. It remains on your device and is under your control.

## 3. Data Collected for App Functionality

To provide core features, the App may interact with a limited amount of technical data.

*   **Device ID for Notifications:** If you choose to set a reminder, the app uses your device's operating system to schedule a local notification. This process may involve the use of your device's unique identifier to deliver the notification correctly. This identifier is used solely for the purpose of scheduling and delivering reminders as requested by you and is not used for tracking or any other purpose.

## 4. Data Storage

All user-entered data is stored locally on your device using on-device storage. If you delete the App, this data will also be deleted.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
