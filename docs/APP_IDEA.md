# ðŸ§  Food & Mood Tracker â€“ Current Summary

## ðŸŒ± What It Is

A mindful eating companion that helps users reflect on how food affects their mood, energy, and emotions â€” without calorie counting, restriction, or judgment.

## ðŸ“² What the App Does

### Two-Part Meal Check-Ins

-   **Before Eating:** Log mood, energy, hunger, intention for eating, and what you plan to eat.
-   **After Eating:** Reflect on fullness, mood shifts, energy, and how the meal felt.

### Emotion Awareness

-   Users check in using a guided emotion matrix (based on body tone, energy, and emotional valence).
-   Encourages self-awareness around tension, emotional eating, or disconnection.

### Insightful Dashboard

-   Visual patterns show how meals impact mood, energy, and habits over time.
-   Designed to support behavior change through reflection, not tracking numbers.

### Reminders & Habit Support

-   Optional SMS or push reminders help users complete post-meal check-ins.
-   Intention-setting during onboarding supports personal goals (e.g., more energy, less guilt, emotional awareness).

### Privacy-First & Lightweight

-   No calorie counts, no public profiles.
-   Data is stored locally or minimally synced depending on platform.

## ðŸ’¡ Why It's Different

-   Focuses on the *why* and *how* of eating, not just the *what*.
-   Helps users understand emotional patterns and energy shifts.
-   Built with mindfulness, behavior change science, and real user feedback at the core.
